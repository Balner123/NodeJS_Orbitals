# Orbitals_Model 

This project is try to graphic represent "_Orbitals Curves_" and it can be getting as "_Fourier Transformation_" (in extra-minimal-bad sense).

Base of this try is [script.js] in which _madness is hiding on every corner, and where _recursive fucntions_ have blocked access_.
* It's simple **JavaSript** with **p5.js** library for rendering Canvas

> I won't give any Advices like "How to use" that script, because those which are curious about "how it works?" will find it out fast in any case,
and these those not will be drive away faster too...

## Portfolio
> is different thing (obviously). This portfolio is supposed to collect Parameters of these curves, which "_gained visitor's attention for its Beauty or Speciality_"
* Running on **Node.JS** with **Express** module.

To add some **Parameters** to this portfolio is necessarily to click (<code>/model</code> route) on **EXPORT PARAMETERS** button and Enter **NAME** of the curve.
Then parameters will be sent to server and saved into **JSON** file.

> Yes, yes, any database...

In <code>/portfolio </code> afterwards you will able to click on the CARD with these parameters and REDIRECT to <code>/model</code> to see what is growing from such parameters...
